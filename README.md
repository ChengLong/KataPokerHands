# KataPokerHands
[Poker Hands Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataPokerHands) in Scala

## Solution
The main idea is to use extractors to convert `Hand` into `CategorizedHand` and use partial functions to do comparisons.
Take a look at the tests to see how it works.
Comments and suggestions are welcome.
